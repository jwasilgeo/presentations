# Angular and the ArcGIS API for JavaScript

Angular 1 and 2 are popular application frameworks that focus on extending HTML with custom elements and attributes so you can rapidly develop web applications with reusable components. In this session we'll demonstrate "angular-esri-map", an Angular 1 library that will help you use the ArcGIS API for JavaScript in your apps. We'll also explore the latest and greatest patterns for bringing Esri maps and services into your Angular 2 apps.
